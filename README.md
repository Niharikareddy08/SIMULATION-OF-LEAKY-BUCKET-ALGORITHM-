SIMULATION OF LEAKY BUCKET ALGORITHM  using Computer Graphics 
Expanding request on a system with increased connections will greatly drain its capacity. There are diverse congestion control systems with encourages a network system to work in an ideal environment of low latency with high throughput and in this way keeping the system from getting clogged or congested. In this paper, the Leak Bucket Algorithm is used to control transmission rate in a system. It tends to be monitor data transmission and packets (data) to define limits on bandwidth. By setting the bucket size and output rate, congestion can be properly managed to ensure that transmission goes on smoothly in the network. The Leaky Bucket Algorithm ensures bursty and inconsistent packet inputs are moderated and put out as smooth and consistent data. One of the disadvantages of the Leaky Bucket Algorithm is that packets are destroyed instead of tokens, this times lead to packet loss. 

 Software Requirements:
 Operating system : Ubuntu 
Compiler : GCC Compiler integrated with glut package 
Graphics Library : (GL/glut.h) header files

CONCLUSION :
This report has successfully covered some aspects of the Leaky Bucket Algorithm, how it works, its advantages and disadvantages as well as its effect on traffic shaping. It is a good method of congestion control but keeping in mind that packets can go missing due to a full bucket, other methods of control should be considered.
